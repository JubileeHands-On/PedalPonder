Riko@laughing : "when i grew i up a bit i realised that neither mom nor dad is returning again so i was like so devoid of everything then Aku shrugged me off saying#..just this memorial soul#..Zeltie wondered..but given you are why don't you amend yourself to what you are than how to be#..but Yubi still made me cry out saying#..how do you know you were..shh..surplus to emancipation#..then#..Roy tried to console me saying what he means is about assimilation of thoughts in own rather than own in thoughts i said I don't understand one word of it so he scoffed at me saying your trouble is no more than an official relationship using which the dreges of logic will try to furnish their thoughts on MY,MY freedom of soul,hence day one a year back you declared our involuntary ways..and we were 5 years old#,old enough to distinguish between contentment in a method and limitations in seeking..more#..and ofcourse that's why i did this..there are many a vultures,looking to find self not out of obviousness of presence but out of choice of presence..it doesn't work either in axiomatic or in emotional fields only parametric field that you're aiming for move it#..anyhow so they combined did relieve me but we didn't come to know about our parents till 5 because Mr. üê∫ vowed that he would resolve it but though he failed to link my parents with the case he did hit a wing of the crudest interregional nexus hence we were put on alert and thus only came to know..but i with many a conflict in my mind wandered off to an empty unused classroom after the end of the day none of my 2 elder siblings were there that day..Yubi and Roy had left all institutionalizations a year back already#..anyhow i was sitting there lost in thoughts when suddenly hearing the city bell striking 18:00 i woke up to the fact that the door was closed and i was trapped in there..for heaven's sake wish atleast i'm alone in this haunted room#..so i quietly sat in a corner covered holding my bag to my chest curled up not realising how i missed the massive sound of the door being closed or why none searched in#..it was a store room of old painting and other things which ensured probably that even if someone came won't find me being lost in all the small lanes dividing the piles..anyhow i had very little water left no food so didn't know if i would survive or not now Roy and all being also away from city with their parents it will take a long time for the search party to come for me#..by the time these thoughts ended it was 19:00#..thirsty and hungry wanting to excrete i tried to go to another place when the small bulb shorted and i was left in pure darkness now away from my sheltering corner..in stupendous fear of being eaten up alive by something which suddenly stuck me must've happened to mom and dad i excreted there as a reaction tried to cry out but was choked not being helped by lack of water..now with this background i realised why absolute compassion alone is to be held onto with more eagerness than my own self which i was trying to understand as equal only#..anyhow exactly here i hear something right behind me.."
Roy@laughing : "In some fiction in action in some thoughts/in contradiction conviction of in opt(s)/in some poise in some noise in some voidness/left to be i..but who?..Hellow Consciousness..

Oh Stumbled on A Random Night All to Find Me/No More Than or As I or Me or Thy..Conclusion Jubilee!
How?..Hands-on..SIMILE.."
Riko@laughing : "i instantly fainted only to wake up to Roy crouching over me much concerned now seeing me wake up is so relieved signals me not to talk then tenders my head a bit then leaves when others come in..only to be dispersed by Mr üê∫ exploding into the room furiously asking me did you got lost seeing a picture of falling dusk behind a returner who looks back without any expression i was like to bemused to reply when Yubie wriggled away from the guards being fend off by Aku,Roy and Zeltie and giggling saying yeah i saw that too the painter was so lost in own thoughts nana#..,Mr üê∫ became angrier saying yeah now see what happens to..The Cosmos#.."
Ayub(laughing) : "no i'm honest I'm patient and i'm with perseverance what more can i do,Solo Solo Solo Solo Solo I/Hands-On Yet Oh Jubilee!..As Found Bein'..MY,#,Akpofure&Zeltzin..Hellow Jubilee,#,.."
