Misty(laughing..) : "no then my bee said only as i was getting prepared to launch an assault on your conviction that you were separate..from you#..i also understood why all my brats and yours and so on are ok well skilled or not but really i didn't understand what exactly and why specifically is the need for separation from anything do these two lowlifes have who usurped me i was more common to certainly that application necessity testing b.. Blossie atleast#..,i said that's why this creature that day could manage the local assaulters as the involutional aspect managed the interregional prospects#..while Mr Cubin was forced to manage the authority and Jenny bored all the outside staffs to death once more with normalcy#..all the while Margin and Blithie kept our functions going everywhere and Mr Skechit obviously was put up to manage the Cerulean gym why he is half an owner there#..so he along with only Dr Oak was forced to manage emotions once more..of the whole world as they came up against the other nuisances#..but then i don't know you know why and how these two volunteered into our personal situation their own counterparts chose Genkie and Blossie and are the rest what exactly does these two low modalities chose me and are so different,i said um may be because why i was still psychologically well despite your accusations was that whenever i felt completely lost they told me in this tone..
oh no no oh sup sup sup sup wo qo ah oh Charred/became my self just as i was..Oh Fuh..SPUR!..
what's that?
Hail New New New New..BARS..
i wanted to kill them but then realised that feeling converted my dejection into revenge so was befuddled completely and so on#..Novelty agnostic Lives,#,..then Ash said they though have forecasted rightly they were the the ones who told me that DaisyDevil and VillieVolt will oppose you,Dr Oak will support you i said Mrs Oak i will manage anyhow i know Mrs Oak so..well#..said but Dr. Slate will not support you but your Gyarados but i didn't understand their logic so opposed them but they were right you know#..they said in this tone..
seek find refine..END..
if so so..oh feelin' that..
why don't you tackle now..feelin' of have?..
doubt askin'..who or what..
search now so try to cement..question's..want..
end noted felt..done..
feelin' has got the whole world..in my hand..
i why do you thus try to win..over deeds of..own hand?..
they added nodding though that this if was really felt and not felt as true he wouldn't take a side master brat just like what's mine..how can you say it's your or not your when you want it to be independent of what i'm#..Feelin' Ends,#,..then Ash said when later i confronted them why didn't you do anything about it hum this is copybook definition of WRONG Knowledge#..,they were so surprised said your manifestation though says you are your metaphysics told us it was only as you are thus we got detached to you master brat when we failed to understand our attempts,hard work behind us to make us exist hence we realised Ash : but this Position is too Misty..
i realised Mist why Mrs always told me üêâ and üëª don't mix normally you can either be elusive or inexistent but can't be both..unless..for the Shadows beside the path to Truth existent on assurance of truth but inexistent on analysis of truth(all un..very long,..Ash : but this Position is too Misty,#,..Lillie.. Phantom : NoFurtherYonders,#,..)"
